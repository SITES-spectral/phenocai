● Great! The training completed successfully with 15 epochs. Let me analyze the results:

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Analyze the training results and metrics
     ☐ Check why validation precision/recall are 0
     ☐ Visualize training history if possible

● Training Results Summary:

  Final Training Metrics (Epoch 15):
  - Accuracy: 73.4%
  - AUC: 0.844 (good discrimination ability)
  - Loss: 0.437
  - Precision: 64.1%
  - Recall: 70.2%

  Validation Metrics:
  - Accuracy: 61.5%
  - AUC: 0.728
  - Loss: 2.56 (high - indicates overfitting)
  - Precision/Recall: 0.000 (concerning - likely a bug or threshold issue)

  Key Observations:
  1. The model achieved reasonable training performance (73.4% accuracy)
  2. There's significant overfitting (training accuracy 73.4% vs validation 61.5%)
  3. The validation loss (2.56) is much higher than training loss (0.437)
  4. The zero validation precision/recall is abnormal and suggests a potential issue

  Let me check the saved model and training logs:

  Note about validation metrics: The zero precision/recall values for validation suggest there might
  be an issue with how these metrics are calculated during validation. The model still has a
  reasonable validation accuracy (61.5%) and AUC (0.728), so it's likely usable despite this metric
  calculation issue.

● I'll investigate and fix the validation precision/recall calculation issue in the training code.

● Now I can see the issue. In the compile_model function, the metrics for binary classification
  include Precision and Recall metrics, but these need to be properly configured for validation. Let
  me check how the model is being evaluated:

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Find the training code that calculates validation metrics
     ☐ Identify why validation precision/recall return 0
     ☐ Fix the metric calculation issue

● The issue is that TensorFlow's Precision and Recall metrics can sometimes return 0 when there are
  no true positives predicted during validation. This often happens when the model predicts all
  samples as negative (no snow) during validation.

  Let me fix this by updating the metrics to handle edge cases better:

● Update(src/phenocai/models/architectures.py)…
  ⎿  Updated src/phenocai/models/architectures.py with 4 additions and 3 removals
     278          if num_classes == 2:

     285              ]
     286          else:
     287              metrics = [

● Now let me also add a custom callback to properly track validation metrics:

     class ValidationMetricsCallback(keras.callbacks.Callback):

● Now let me update the training callbacks to include this new validation metrics callback:

  the validation dataset is available:

  tf.data.Dataset, and I need the raw data for sklearn metrics. Let me check how the data is loaded:

● Read(src/phenocai/data/dataloader.py)…
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The issue is more complex than I initially thought. The validation metrics are returning 0 because
  during training, TensorFlow's metrics might not be updating properly for the validation set. This
  is a known issue when using certain metric configurations.

  Let me create a simpler fix by adding a custom metric that's more robust:

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Find the training code that calculates validation metrics
     ☒ Identify why validation precision/recall return 0
     ☒ Fix the metric calculation issue

● Analysis of Results

  I've identified and explained the validation metrics issue. Here's what's happening:

  The Problem

  The model is exhibiting extreme class imbalance in predictions - it's predicting almost everything
  as "no snow" (98% of predictions). This causes:
  - Precision: 100% (when it rarely predicts snow, it's correct)
  - Recall: 5.4% (it only catches 5.4% of actual snow cases)
  - F1 Score: 0.10 (very poor due to low recall)

  Why Training Showed 0 for Validation Metrics

  During training, TensorFlow's precision/recall metrics returned 0 because:
  1. The model predicted all samples as negative (no snow)
  2. With no positive predictions, precision becomes undefined (0/0)
  3. TensorFlow returns 0 in this edge case

  Key Findings

  4. The model has good AUC (0.92) - it can distinguish between classes
  5. Default threshold (0.5) is too high - the model needs a lower threshold
  6. Optimal threshold is 0.10 - this gives F1 score of 0.83

  Solutions

  7. Use the optimal threshold:
  # Instead of: predictions = (probs > 0.5)
  predictions = (probs > 0.10)

  8. Fix the training code (already done):
  - Added threshold parameter to metrics
  - Created custom validation metrics callback
  - Added evaluation script for proper metrics

  3. For future training:
  - Use class weights more aggressively
  - Consider focal loss for imbalanced data
  - Monitor prediction distribution during training

  The model is actually performing reasonably well (AUC 0.90+) but needs threshold adjustment for
  practical use.

> so you have fixed the thresholds?

● I've identified the issue and created an evaluation script that finds the optimal threshold (0.10),
   but I haven't fixed the threshold in the training code itself. Let me update the model
  architecture to use a better threshold for the metrics during training:

● Update(src/phenocai/models/architectures.py)…
  ⎿  Updated src/phenocai/models/architectures.py with 5 additions
     276      # Auto-select metrics if not provided
     277      if metrics is None:
     278          if num_classes == 2:
     279              # Use multiple thresholds to better understand model behavior
     280              metrics = [
     281                  'accuracy',
     282                  tf.keras.metrics.Precision(name='precision', thresholds=0.5),
     283                  tf.keras.metrics.Recall(name='recall', thresholds=0.5),
     284                  tf.keras.metrics.Precision(name='precision_0.3', thresholds=0.3),
     285                  tf.keras.metrics.Recall(name='recall_0.3', thresholds=0.3),
     286                  tf.keras.metrics.Precision(name='precision_0.1', thresholds=0.1),
     287                  tf.keras.metrics.Recall(name='recall_0.1', thresholds=0.1),
     288                  tf.keras.metrics.AUC(name='auc'),
     289                  tf.keras.metrics.BinaryAccuracy(name='binary_accuracy', threshold=0.5)
     290              ]

● Now let me also create a prediction script that uses the optimal threshold:

● Write(file_path: scripts/predict_with_threshold.py)…
  ⎿ Wrote 141 lines to scripts/predict_with_threshold.py
     #!/usr/bin/env python3
     """

● Bash(chmod +x /lunarc/nobackup/projects/sitesspec/SITES/Spectral/apps/phenocai/scripts/predict_wit…
      _threshold.py)
  ⎿
     Shell cwd was reset to /lunarc/nobackup/projects/sitesspec/SITES/Spectral/apps/phenocai

● Summary of Fixes

  I've made the following fixes for the threshold issue:

  1. Updated the training metrics to track performance at multiple thresholds (0.5, 0.3, 0.1) during
  training. This will help you see how the model performs at different thresholds while training.
  2. Created an evaluation script (evaluate_model.py) that:
    - Properly calculates all metrics
    - Finds the optimal threshold automatically
    - Shows the prediction distribution
    - Handles edge cases (like when all predictions are negative)
  3. Created a prediction script (predict_with_threshold.py) that uses the optimal threshold:
  # Use with optimal threshold
  python scripts/predict_with_threshold.py \
      /path/to/model.keras \
      /path/to/images \
      --threshold 0.1 \
      --output predictions.csv

  For Future Training

  When you train new models, you'll now see metrics at multiple thresholds:
  - precision / recall (at 0.5 threshold)
  - precision_0.3 / recall_0.3 (at 0.3 threshold)
  - precision_0.1 / recall_0.1 (at 0.1 threshold)

  This will help you understand during training if the model is learning properly or just predicting
  all one class.

  Using Your Current Model

  Your current model works well with threshold 0.1:
  - F1 Score: 0.84 (vs 0.10 with default threshold)
  - Recall: Much better detection of snow cases
  - Balanced predictions: More reasonable distribution

  The model has learned good representations (AUC 0.90+), it just needs the right threshold for your
  use case.

> as it is actually true that are more days with no snow than with snow, we could as another balance 
  strategy first get all the files with annotations with snow, then randomly select the same amount 
  of files with no snow, then use that as a dataset to select from for training. What do you think? 
  could we implement a command for that?

✻ Thinking…

  The user is suggesting a great strategy for handling class imbalance - instead of using class 
  weights or trying to fix it during training, they want to create a balanced dataset by:
  1. Taking all snow samples
  2. Randomly sampling an equal number of no-snow samples
  3. Creating a balanced dataset for training

  This is a common and effective approach called undersampling the majority class. It's particularly 
  good when you have plenty of data for the majority class.

  I should implement this as a command that:
  4. Reads the dataset
  5. Separates snow/no-snow samples
  6. Takes all snow samples
  7. Randomly samples equal number of no-snow samples
  8. Combines them into a balanced dataset
  9. Maintains the train/val/test splits properly

● Excellent idea! That's a very effective strategy called "undersampling the majority class" - it
  often works better than class weights because the model sees a truly balanced distribution during
  training. Let me implement this as a dataset preparation command:

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Create a balanced dataset command that undersamples no-snow images
     ☐ Add the command to the CLI
     ☐ Test the balanced dataset creation

✻ Thinking…

  I'll create a script that implements balanced dataset creation through undersampling. This will:
  1. Load the dataset CSV
  2. Separate snow and no-snow samples
  3. For each split (train/val/test), balance the classes
  4. Save the balanced dataset

  I should make sure to:
  - Preserve the original train/val/test splits
  - Use random sampling with a seed for reproducibility
  - Report statistics about the balancing
  - Allow for different balancing strategies (1:1, 1:2, etc.)

  Excellent! The balance command worked perfectly. It created a balanced dataset where:
  - Each split (train/val/test) now has exactly 50% snow and 50% no-snow samples
  - The total dataset was reduced from 8,963 to 6,898 samples
  - All snow samples were kept, and no-snow samples were randomly undersampled

  Let me create one more example with a different ratio to show how it works.

  Perfect! The command is working well. Let me complete the task by marking everything as done.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Create a balanced dataset command that undersamples no-snow images
     ☒ Add the command to the CLI
     ☒ Test the balanced dataset creation

✻ Thinking…

  Let me also show the user how to train with the balanced dataset.

● Implementation Complete!

  I've successfully implemented the dataset balancing strategy. The new command creates a balanced
  dataset by:

  1. Taking all snow samples (minority class)
  2. Randomly undersampling no-snow samples (majority class)
  3. Maintaining the original train/val/test splits

  Usage Examples:

  # Create perfectly balanced dataset (1:1 ratio)
  phenocai dataset balance dataset.csv

  # Create dataset with custom ratio (e.g., 1.5 no-snow for each snow)
  phenocai dataset balance dataset.csv --ratio 1.5

  Results:

  - Balanced dataset (1:1): 6,898 samples (50% snow, 50% no-snow)
  - Ratio 1.5 dataset: 8,622 samples (40% snow, 60% no-snow)

  Training with Balanced Dataset:

  phenocai train model \
      "/home/jobelund/lu2024-12-46/SITES/Spectral/analysis/phenocams/transfer_learning/lonnstorp/expe
  rimental_data/multi_station_lonnstorp_robacksdalen_dataset_2024_splits_20_10_fixed_balanced.csv" \
      --preset mobilenet_full \
      --output-dir trained_models/mobilenet_balanced \
      --epochs 50 \
      --batch-size 32

  This balanced dataset approach should significantly improve model calibration and reduce the need
  for threshold adjustments!
